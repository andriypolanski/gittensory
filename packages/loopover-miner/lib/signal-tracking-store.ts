// AMS adapter for @loopover/engine's shared signal-tracking primitive (#7982). WRAPS the miner's existing
// local, append-only event-ledger.js -- no new table, no new storage mechanism -- the same "reuse, don't
// rewrite" contract ORB's own adapter (src/review/signal-tracking-wire.ts) follows for audit_events.
//
// Event-ledger vocabulary: two typed event kinds, mirroring MINER_PR_OUTCOME_EVENT's own naming convention
// (pr-outcome.ts). ruleId/outcome/verdict/extra metadata live in the ledger's `payload` (a plain JSON object,
// the ledger's own storage unit) -- there is no indexed column to fold ruleId into the way ORB's audit_events
// event_type affords, so queryRuleHistory reads the WHOLE ledger and filters client-side, mirroring
// calibration-cli.ts's toOutcomeRecords (the ledger's only other "scan + typed filter" reader). Fine for AMS's
// bounded, single-operator local volume; not a hosted-scale query pattern -- a future issue can index this if
// it ever needs to be.
